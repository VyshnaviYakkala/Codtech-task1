Version Control with Git in DevOps

Overview

Git is an essential tool in DevOps for managing source code, automating deployments, and enabling collaboration between development and operations teams. It plays a key role in Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and GitOps, ensuring efficient software delivery and infrastructure automation.

This repository provides insights into best practices for using Git in a DevOps workflow, including branching strategies, CI/CD integration, Git hooks, tagging, and GitOps for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Key Features

🚀 Git Workflows in DevOps

Feature Branching: Isolates feature development before merging into the main branch.

GitFlow: Structured workflow with develop, main, feature, release, and hotfix branches.

Trunk-Based Development: Frequent commits to main with feature flags.


⚙️ CI/CD Integration

Git integrates with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Azure DevOps to automate builds, tests, and deployments.

Example GitHub Actions CI pipeline:

on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: npm install && npm test

🔄 Git Hooks for Automation

Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality (e.g., linting, tests).

Post-receive hooks automate deployments after a push.


Example pre-commit hook to enforce tests:

#!/bin/sh
npm test || exit 1

📌 Versioning with Git Tags

Mark releases using tags (v1.0.0, v2.0.0-beta).

Easily roll back to stable versions.


Example:

git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

🛠 GitOps: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

GitOps enables infrastructure automation using tools like ArgoCD, FluxCD, and Kubernetes.

Example: Kubernetes deployment triggered by Git changes:

on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: kubectl apply -f k8s/

Best Practices

✔️ Follow branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based).
✔️ Use Git hooks for automated quality checks.
✔️ Integrate Git with CI/CD pipelines.
✔️ Adopt GitOps for infrastructure automation.
✔️ Implement semantic versioning with Git tags.
✔️ Enforce security and compliance in Git workflows.

Conclusion

Git is a fundamental tool in DevOps workflows, ensuring smooth collaboration, automated deployments, and version control. By integrating Git with CI/CD, GitOps, and infrastructure as code, teams can accelerate software delivery and maintain high stability.
